# Game Description

Hey guys,

Flying Weapons is a cross-platform 2d shoot-em-up in a 3d world.
It is designed and tested with XBox Controllers and Android Phones with Accelerometers.

Keyboard Controls: You shoot with left mouse button or left ctrl.

This game is 100% “Made in Unity on Linux”.
This was one buggy ride (Unity Editor for linux is in Alpha).
That’s also the reason why I didn’t have a web version immediately after the jam.

I managed to make the game I wanted to, but the boss fight didn’t make it in time. I’m still somewhat happy with the result.
